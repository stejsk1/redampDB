### Optimization, migration, customization
- Optimization:  
    - Upgrading the code to make more use of the numpy library and pandas to increase code efficiency.
        - The very first launch of the program:
            - Test before optimization record total time: 2 minutes 37 seconds.
            - Test after optimization record total time: 41.8579 s
            - Depending on HW.
    - Correction of errors in code.
- Migration:
    - Code modification:
        - Switching from outdated versions of libraries to current ones.  
        See the `requirements.txt` file for more information.
    - Upgrading to the latest `python 3.11.4` version.
- Customization:
    - All descriptions will be in English. 
        - This also applies to the `README` file, which has been rewritten.  
        Its older version in Czech will be renamed to `CZ_README` and will not be the main `README` file for github.
